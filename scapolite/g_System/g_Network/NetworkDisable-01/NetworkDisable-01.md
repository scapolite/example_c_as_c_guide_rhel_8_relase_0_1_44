## /rule

Disable Client Dynamic DNS Updates

## /rationale

Dynamic
DNS updates transmit unencrypted information about a system including
its name and address and should not be used unless needed.

## /description

Dynamic
DNS allows clients to dynamically update their own DNS records. The
updates are transmitted by unencrypted means which can reveal
information to a potential malicious user. If the system does not
require Dynamic DNS, remove all `DHCP_HOSTNAME` references from the
`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface` scripts. If `dhclient`
is used, remove all `send host-name hostname` references from the
`/etc/dhclient.conf` configuration file and/or any reference from the
`/etc/dhcp` directory.
