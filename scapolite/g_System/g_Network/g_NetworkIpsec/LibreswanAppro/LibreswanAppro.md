## /rule

Verify Any Configured IPSec Tunnel Connections

## /rationale

IP
tunneling mechanisms can be used to bypass network filtering.

## /description

Libreswan
provides an implementation of IPsec and IKE, which permits the creation
of secure tunnels over untrusted networks. As such, IPsec can be used to
circumvent certain network requirements such as filtering. Verify that
if any IPsec connection (`conn`) configured in `/etc/ipsec.conf` and
`/etc/ipsec.d` exists is an approved organizational connection.
