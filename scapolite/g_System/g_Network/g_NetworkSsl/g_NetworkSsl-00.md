## /description

Support
for Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its predecessor, the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), is included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux in the
OpenSSL software (RPM package `openssl`). TLS provides encrypted and
authenticated network communications, and many network services include
support for it. TLS or SSL can be leveraged to avoid any plaintext
transmission of sensitive data.  
For information on how to use OpenSSL, see
**<http://www.openssl.org/docs/>**. Information on FIPS validation of
OpenSSL is available at **<http://www.openssl.org/docs/fips.html>** and
**<http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm>**.
