## /rule

Configure Multiple DNS Servers in /etc/resolv.conf

## /rationale

To
provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant
name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to
the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may
include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote
system logging.

## /description

Multiple
Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured in
`/etc/resolv.conf`. This provides redundant name resolution services in
the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to
contain as least `2` DNS servers, add a corresponding
`nameserver ip_address` entry in `/etc/resolv.conf` for each DNS server
where *ip\_address* is the IP address of a valid DNS server. For
example:

``` 
search example.com
nameserver 192.168.0.1
nameserver 192.168.0.2
```
