## /rule

Configure Kernel Parameter for Accepting Source-Routed Packets for
Interfaces By Default

## /rationale

Source-routed
packets allow the source of the packet to suggest routers forward the
packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can
be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies
only to the forwarding of source-routerd traffic, such as when IPv6
forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.
Accepting source-routed packets in the IPv6 protocol has few legitimate
uses. It should be disabled unless it is absolutely required.

## /description

To
set the runtime status of the
`net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route` kernel parameter, run the
following command:

``` 
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route=0
```

If this is not the system default value, add the following line to a
file in the directory `/etc/sysctl.d`:

``` 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
```
