## /rule

Verify firewalld Enabled

## /rationale

Access
control methods provide the ability to enhance system security posture
by restricting services and known good IP addresses and address ranges.
This prevents connections from unknown hosts and protocols.

## /description

The `firewalld` service can be enabled with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service
```
