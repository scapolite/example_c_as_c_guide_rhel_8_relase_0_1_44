## /rule

Ensure auditd Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands -
userhelper

## /rationale

Misuse
of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have
compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can
have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of
privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the
risk from insider and advanced persistent threast.  
  
Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary
but limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these
programs for unusual activity.

## /description

At
a minimum, the audit system should collect the execution of privileged
commands for all users and root. If the `auditd` daemon is configured to
use the `augenrules` program to read audit rules during daemon startup
(the default), add a line of the following form to a file with suffix
`.rules` in the directory `/etc/audit/rules.d`:

``` 
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/userhelper -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged
```

If the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the `auditctl` utility to
read audit rules during daemon startup, add a line of the following form
to `/etc/audit/audit.rules`:

``` 
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/userhelper -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged
```
