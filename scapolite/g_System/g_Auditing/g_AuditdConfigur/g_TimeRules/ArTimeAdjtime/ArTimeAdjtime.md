## /rule

Record attempts to alter time through adjtimex

## /rationale

Arbitrary
changes to the system time can be used to obfuscate nefarious activities
in log files, as well as to confuse network services that are highly
dependent upon an accurate system time (such as sshd). All changes to
the system time should be audited.

## /description

If
the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the `augenrules` program to
read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the following
line to a file with suffix `.rules` in the directory
`/etc/audit/rules.d`:

``` 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -F key=audit_time_rules
```

If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

``` 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -F key=audit_time_rules
```

If the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the `auditctl` utility to
read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
`/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

``` 
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -F key=audit_time_rules
```

If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

``` 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -F key=audit_time_rules
```

The -k option allows for the specification of a key in string form that
can be used for better reporting capability through ausearch and
aureport. Multiple system calls can be defined on the same line to save
space if desired, but is not required. See an example of multiple
combined syscalls:

``` 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex,settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules
```
