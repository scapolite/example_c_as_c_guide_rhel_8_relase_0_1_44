## /rule

Shutdown System When Auditing Failures Occur

## /rationale

It
is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at
risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this
notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending
failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely
affected.  
  
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in
the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached
or exceeded.

## /description

If
the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the `augenrules` program to
read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the following
line to a file with suffix `.rules` in the directory
`/etc/audit/rules.d`:

``` 
-f 2
```

If the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the `auditctl` utility to
read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to the
top of the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

``` 
-f 2
```
