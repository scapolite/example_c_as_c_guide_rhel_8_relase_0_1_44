## /rule

Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Owned by a System Account

## /rationale

Allowing
a user account to own a world-writable directory is undesirable because
it allows the owner of that directory to remove or replace any files
that may be placed in the directory by other users.

## /description

All
directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be owned
by root or another system account. If any world-writable directories are
not owned by a system account, this should be investigated. Following
this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an appropriate group.
