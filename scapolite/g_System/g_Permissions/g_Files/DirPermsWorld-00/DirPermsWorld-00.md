## /rule

Verify that All World-Writable Directories Have Sticky Bits Set

## /rationale

Failing
to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to
delete files in the directory structure.  
  
The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file
repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by
the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as `/tmp`), and
for directories requiring global read/write access.

## /description

When
the so-called \'sticky bit\' is set on a directory, only the owner of a
given file may remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky
bit, any user with write access to a directory may remove any file in
the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from removing each
other\'s files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather
than to set the sticky bit. However, if a directory is used by a
particular application, consult that application\'s documentation
instead of blindly changing modes.  
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory *DIR*, run the
following command:

``` 
$ sudo chmod +t DIR
```
