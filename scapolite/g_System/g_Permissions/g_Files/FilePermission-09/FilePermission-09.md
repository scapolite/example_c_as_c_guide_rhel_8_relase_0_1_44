## /rule

Ensure All SUID Executables Are Authorized

## /rationale

Executable
files with the SUID permission run with the privileges of the owner of
the file. SUID files of uncertain provenance could allow for
unprivileged users to elevate privileges. The presence of these files
should be strictly controlled on the system.

## /description

The
SUID (set user id) bit should be set only on files that were installed
via authorized means. A straightforward means of identifying
unauthorized SGID files is determine if any were not installed as part
of an RPM package, which is cryptographically verified. Investigate the
origin of any unpackaged SUID files.
