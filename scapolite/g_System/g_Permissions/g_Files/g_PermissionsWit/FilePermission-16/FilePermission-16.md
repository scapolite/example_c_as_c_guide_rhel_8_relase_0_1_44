## /rule

Verify that Shared Library Files Have Restrictive Permissions

## /rationale

Files
from shared library directories are loaded into the address space of
processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
runtime. Restrictive permissions are necessary to protect the integrity
of the system.

## /description

System-wide
shared library files, which are linked to executables during process
load time or run time, are stored in the following directories by
default:

``` 
/lib
/lib64
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64
```

Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are
stored in `/lib/modules`. All files in these directories should not be
group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these directories is
found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission
with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo chmod go-w FILE
```
