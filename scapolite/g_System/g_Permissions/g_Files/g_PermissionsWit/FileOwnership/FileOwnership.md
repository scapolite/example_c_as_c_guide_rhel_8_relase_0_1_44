## /rule

Verify that System Executables Have Root Ownership

## /rationale

System
binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system services,
and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their execution
of these programs cannot be co-opted.

## /description

System
executables are stored in the following directories by default:

``` 
/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/libexec
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/sbin
```

All files in these directories should be owned by the `root` user. If
any file *FILE* in these directories is found to be owned by a user
other than root, correct its ownership with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo chown root FILE
```
