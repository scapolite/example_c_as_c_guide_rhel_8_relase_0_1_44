## /rule

Ensure No World-Writable Files Exist

## /rationale

Data
in world-writable files can be modified by any user on the system. In
almost all circumstances, files can be configured using a combination of
user and group permissions to support whatever legitimate access is
needed without the risk caused by world-writable files.

## /description

It
is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write access to a file
when it is discovered. However, check with documentation for specific
applications before making changes. Also, monitor for recurring
world-writable files, as these may be symptoms of a misconfigured
application or user account. Finally, this applies to real files and not
virtual files that are a part of pseudo file systems such as `sysfs` or
`procfs`.
