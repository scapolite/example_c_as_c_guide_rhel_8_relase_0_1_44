## /rule

Disable Booting from USB Devices in Boot Firmware

## /rationale

Booting
a system from a USB device would allow an attacker to circumvent any
security measures provided by the operating system. Attackers could
mount partitions and modify the configuration of the OS.

## /description

Configure
the system boot firmware (historically called BIOS on PC systems) to
disallow booting from USB drives.
