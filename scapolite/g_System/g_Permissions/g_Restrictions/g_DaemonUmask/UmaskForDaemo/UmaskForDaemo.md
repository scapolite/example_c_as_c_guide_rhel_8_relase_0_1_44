## /rule

Set Daemon Umask

## /rationale

The
umask influences the permissions assigned to files created by a process
at run time. An unnecessarily permissive umask could result in files
being created with insecure permissions.

## /description

The
file `/etc/init.d/functions` includes initialization parameters for most
or all daemons started at boot time. Many daemons on the system already
individually restrict themselves to a umask of `077` in their own init
scripts. By default, the umask of `022` is set which prevents creation
of group- or world-writable files. To set the umask for daemons expected
by the profile, edit the following line:

``` {html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" ns0="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"}
umask 
```
