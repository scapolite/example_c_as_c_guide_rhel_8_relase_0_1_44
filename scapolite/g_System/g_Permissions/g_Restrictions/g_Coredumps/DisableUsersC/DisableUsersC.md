## /rule

Disable Core Dumps for All Users

## /rationale

A
core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

## /description

To
disable core dumps for all users, add the following line to
`/etc/security/limits.conf`:

``` 
*     hard   core    0
```
