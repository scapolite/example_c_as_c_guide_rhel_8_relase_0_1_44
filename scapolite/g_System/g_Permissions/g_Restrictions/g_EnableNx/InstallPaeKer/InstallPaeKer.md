## /rule

Install PAE Kernel on Supported 32-bit x86 Systems

## /rationale

On
32-bit systems that support the XD or NX bit, the vendor-supplied PAE
kernel is required to enable either Execute Disable (XD) or No Execute
(NX) support.

## /description

Systems
that are using the 64-bit x86 kernel package do not need to install the
kernel-PAE package because the 64-bit x86 kernel already includes this
support. However, if the system is 32-bit and also supports the PAE and
NX features as determined in the previous section, the kernel-PAE
package should be installed to enable XD or NX support. The `kernel-PAE`
package can be installed with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo yum install kernel-PAE
```

The installation process should also have configured the bootloader to
load the new kernel at boot. Verify this after reboot and modify
`/etc/default/grub` if necessary.
