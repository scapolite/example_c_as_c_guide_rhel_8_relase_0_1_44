## /rule

Enable NX or XD Support in the BIOS

## /rationale

Computers
with the ability to prevent this type of code execution frequently put
an option in the BIOS that will allow users to turn the feature on or
off at will.

## /description

Reboot
the system and enter the BIOS or Setup configuration menu. Navigate the
BIOS configuration menu and make sure that the option is enabled. The
setting may be located under a Security section. Look for Execute
Disable (XD) on Intel-based systems and No Execute (NX) on AMD-based
systems.
