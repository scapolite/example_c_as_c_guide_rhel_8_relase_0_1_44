## /rule

Ensure Logs Sent To Remote Host

## /rationale

A
log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more systems.
This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a system
is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages
to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a
centralized place to view the status of multiple hosts within the
enterprise.

## /description

To
configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server, open
`/etc/rsyslog.conf` and read and understand the last section of the
file, which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate
remote logging. Along with these other directives, the system can be
configured to forward its logs to a particular log server by adding or
correcting one of the following lines, substituting
`loghost.example.com` appropriately. The choice of protocol depends on
the environment of the system; although TCP and RELP provide more
reliable message delivery, they may not be supported in all
environments.  
To use UDP for log message delivery:

``` 
*.* @loghost.example.com
```

  
To use TCP for log message delivery:

``` 
*.* @@loghost.example.com
```

  
To use RELP for log message delivery:

``` 
*.* :omrelp:loghost.example.com
```

  
There must be a resolvable DNS CNAME or Alias record set to \"\" for
logs to be sent correctly to the centralized logging utility.
