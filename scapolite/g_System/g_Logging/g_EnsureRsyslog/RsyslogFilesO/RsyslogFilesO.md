## /rule

Ensure Log Files Are Owned By Appropriate User

## /rationale

The
log files generated by rsyslog contain valuable information regarding
system configuration, user authentication, and other such information.
Log files should be protected from unauthorized access.

## /description

The
owner of all log files written by `rsyslog` should be ``. These log
files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in
`/etc/rsyslog.conf` and typically all appear in `/var/log`. For each log
file *LOGFILE* referenced in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, run the following
command to inspect the file\'s owner:

``` 
$ ls -l LOGFILE
```

If the owner is not ``, run the following command to correct this:

``` {html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" ns0="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"}
$ sudo chown  LOGFILE
```
