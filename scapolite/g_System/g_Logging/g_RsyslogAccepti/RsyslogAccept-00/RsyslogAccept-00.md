## /rule

Enable rsyslog to Accept Messages via TCP, if Acting As Log Server

## /rationale

If
the system needs to act as a log server, this ensures that it can
receive messages over a reliable TCP connection.

## /description

The
`rsyslog` daemon should not accept remote messages unless the system
acts as a log server. If the system needs to act as a central log
server, add the following lines to `/etc/rsyslog.conf` to enable
reception of messages over TCP:

``` 
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514
```
