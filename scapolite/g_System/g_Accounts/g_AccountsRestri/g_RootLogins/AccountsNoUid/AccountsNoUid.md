## /rule

Verify Only Root Has UID 0

## /rationale

An
account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts with
a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess a
password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is
recommended to afford multiple system administrators access to root
privileges in an accountable manner.

## /description

If
any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should
be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or
have their UID changed.  
If the account is associated with system commands or applications the
UID should be changed to one greater than \"0\" but less than \"1000.\"
Otherwise assign a UID greater than \"1000\" that has not already been
assigned.
