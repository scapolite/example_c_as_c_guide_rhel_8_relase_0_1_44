          <question_text>To list all password file entries for accounts with UID 0, run the
following command:
$ awk -F: '($3 == \"0\") {print}' /etc/passwd
This should print only one line, for the user root.

If there is a finding, change the UID of the failing (non-root) user. If
the account is associated with the system commands or applications the UID
should be changed to one greater than 0 but less than
1000. Otherwise assign a UID of greater than 1000 that
has not already been assigned.
      Is it the case that any account other than root has a UID of 0?
