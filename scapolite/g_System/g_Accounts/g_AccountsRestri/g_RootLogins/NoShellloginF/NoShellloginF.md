## /rule

Ensure that System Accounts Do Not Run a Shell Upon Login

## /rationale

Ensuring
shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.

## /description

Some
accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and exist
to perform some administrative function. Should an attacker be able to
log into these accounts, they should not be granted access to a shell.  
  
The login shell for each local account is stored in the last field of
each line in `/etc/passwd`. System accounts are those user accounts with
a user ID less than UID\_MIN, where value of UID\_MIN directive is set
in /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default configuration
UID\_MIN is set to 1000, thus system accounts are those user accounts
with a user ID less than 1000. The user ID is stored in the third field.
If any system account *SYSACCT* (other than root) has a login shell,
disable it with the command:

``` 
$ sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin SYSACCT
```
