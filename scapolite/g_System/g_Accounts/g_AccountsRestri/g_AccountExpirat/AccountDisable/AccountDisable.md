## /rule

Set Account Expiration Following Inactivity

## /rationale

Disabling
inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not have been
responsibly removed are not available to attackers who may have
compromised their credentials.

## /description

To
specify the number of days after a password expires (which signifies
inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct the
following lines in `/etc/default/useradd`, substituting `NUM_DAYS`
appropriately:

``` {html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" ns0="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"}
INACTIVE=
```

A value of 35 is recommended; however, this profile expects that the
value is set to ``. If a password is currently on the verge of
expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days,
then 95 days could elapse until the account would be automatically
disabled. See the `useradd` man page for more information. Determining
the inactivity timeout must be done with careful consideration of the
length of a \"normal\" period of inactivity for users in the particular
environment. Setting the timeout too low incurs support costs and also
has the potential to impact availability of the system to legitimate
users.
