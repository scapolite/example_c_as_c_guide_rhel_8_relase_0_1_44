## /rule

Assign Expiration Date to Temporary Accounts

## /rationale

If
temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an
excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized
access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary
accounts must be set upon account creation.

## /description

Temporary
accounts are established as part of normal account activation procedures
when there is a need for short-term accounts. In the event temporary or
emergency accounts are required, configure the system to terminate them
after a documented time period. For every temporary and emergency
account, run the following command to set an expiration date on it,
substituting `USER` and `YYYY-MM-DD` appropriately:

``` 
$ sudo chage -E YYYY-MM-DD USER
```

`YYYY-MM-DD` indicates the documented expiration date for the account.
For U.S. Government systems, the operating system must be configured to
automatically terminate these types of accounts after a period of 72
hours.
