## /rule

Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Burst Action

## /rationale

A
locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

## /description

By
default, `SystemD` will reboot the system if the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key
sequence is pressed Ctrl-Alt-Delete more than 7 times in 2 seconds.  
  
To configure the system to ignore the `CtrlAltDelBurstAction` setting,
add or modify the following to `/etc/systemd/system.conf`:

``` 
CtrlAltDelBurstAction=none
```
