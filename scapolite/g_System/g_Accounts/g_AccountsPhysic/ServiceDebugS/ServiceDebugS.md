## /rule

Disable debug-shell SystemD Service

## /rationale

This
prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
security on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and
gaining root access when the system is rebooted.

## /description

SystemD\'s
`debug-shell` service is intended to diagnose SystemD related boot
issues with various `systemctl` commands. Once enabled and following a
system reboot, the root shell will be available on `tty9` which is
access by pressing `CTRL-ALT-F9`. The `debug-shell` service should only
be used for SystemD related issues and should otherwise be disabled.  
  
By default, the `debug-shell` SystemD service is disabled. The
`debug-shell` service can be disabled with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo systemctl disable debug-shell.service
```
