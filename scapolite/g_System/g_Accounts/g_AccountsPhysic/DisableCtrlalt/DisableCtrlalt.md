## /rule

Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Reboot Activation

## /rationale

A
locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

## /description

By default, `SystemD` will reboot the system if the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key
sequence is pressed.  
  
To configure the system to ignore the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key sequence from
the command line instead of rebooting the system, do either of the
following:

``` 
ln -sf /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/ctrl-alt-del.target
```

or

``` 
systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target
```

  
  
Do not simply delete the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/ctrl-alt-del.service`
file, as this file may be restored during future system updates.
