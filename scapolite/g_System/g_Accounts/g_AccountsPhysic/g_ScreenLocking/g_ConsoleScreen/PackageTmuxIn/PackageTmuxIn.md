## /rule

Install the tmux Package

## /rationale

A
session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work
and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the
absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their
operation system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating
systems need to be able to identify when a user\'s session has idled and
take action to initiate the session lock.  
  
The `tmux` package allows for a session lock to be implemented and
configured.

## /description

To
enable console screen locking, install the `tmux` package. The `tmux`
package can be installed with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo yum install tmux
```

Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following
command:

``` 
$ tmux
```

The console can now be locked with the following key combination:

``` 
ctrl+b :lock-session
```
