## /rule

Set PAM\'s Password Hashing Algorithm

## /rationale

Passwords
need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method
for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be
plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that
are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they
are kepy in plain text.  
  
This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
Additionally, the `crypt_style` configuration option ensures the use of
a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
difficult.

## /description

The
PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted
representations of passwords. In `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`, the
`password` section of the file controls which PAM modules execute during
a password change. Set the `pam_unix.so` module in the `password`
section to include the argument `sha512`, as shown below:  

``` 
password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 other arguments...
```

  
This will help ensure when local users change their passwords, hashes
for the new passwords will be generated using the SHA-512 algorithm.
This is the default.
