## /rule

Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Special Characters

## /rationale

Use
of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
guessing and brute-force attacks.  
  
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater
the number of possble combinations that need to be tested before the
password is compromised. Requiring a minimum number of special
characters makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a
larger search space.

## /description

The
pam\_pwquality module\'s `ocredit=` parameter controls requirements for
usage of special (or \"other\") characters in a password. When set to a
negative number, any password will be required to contain that many
special characters. When set to a positive number, pam\_pwquality will
grant +1 additional length credit for each special character. Modify the
`ocredit` setting in `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` to equal to require
use of a special character in passwords.
