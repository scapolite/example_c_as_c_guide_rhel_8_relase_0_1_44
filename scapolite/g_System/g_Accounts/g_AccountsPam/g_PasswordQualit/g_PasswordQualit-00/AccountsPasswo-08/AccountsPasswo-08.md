## /rule

Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Different Characters

## /rationale

Use
of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
guessing and brute--force attacks.  
  
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater
the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
password is compromised.  
  
Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password
changes ensures that newly changed passwords should not resemble
previously compromised ones. Note that passwords which are changed on
compromised systems will still be compromised, however.

## /description

The
pam\_pwquality module\'s `difok` parameter sets the number of characters
in a password that must not be present in and old password during a
password change.  
  
Modify the `difok` setting in `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` to equal to
require differing characters when changing passwords.
