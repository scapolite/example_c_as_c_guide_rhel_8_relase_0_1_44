## /rule

Ensure that Root\'s Path Does Not Include Relative Paths or Null
Directories

## /rationale

Including
these entries increases the risk that root could execute code from an
untrusted location.

## /description

Ensure
that none of the directories in root\'s path is equal to a single `.`
character, or that it contains any instances that lead to relative path
traversal, such as `..` or beginning a path without the slash (`/`)
character. Also ensure that there are no \"empty\" elements in the path,
such as in these examples:

``` 
PATH=:/bin
PATH=/bin:
PATH=/bin::/sbin
```

These empty elements have the same effect as a single `.` character.
