## /rule

Ensure that User Home Directories are not Group-Writable or
World-Readable

## /rationale

User
home directories contain many configuration files which affect the
behavior of a user\'s account. No user should ever have write permission
to another user\'s home directory. Group shared directories can be
configured in sub-directories or elsewhere in the filesystem if they are
needed. Typically, user home directories should not be world-readable,
as it would disclose file names to other users. If a subset of users
need read access to one another\'s home directories, this can be
provided using groups or ACLs.

## /description

For
each human user of the system, view the permissions of the user\'s home
directory:

``` 
# ls -ld /home/USER
```

Ensure that the directory is not group-writable and that it is not
world-readable. If necessary, repair the permissions:

``` 
# chmod g-w /home/USER
# chmod o-rwx /home/USER
```
