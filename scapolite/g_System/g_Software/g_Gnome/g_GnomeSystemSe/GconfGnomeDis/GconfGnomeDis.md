## /rule

Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Reboot Key Sequence in GNOME

## /rationale

A
locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

## /description

By
default, `GNOME` will reboot the system if the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key
sequence is pressed.  
To configure the system to ignore the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key sequence from
the Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of rebooting the system, run
the following:

``` 
$ sudo gconftool-2 --direct \
  --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
  --type string \
  --set /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/power ""
```
