## /rule

Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Reboot Key Sequence in GNOME3

## /rationale

A
locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

## /description

By
default, `GNOME` will reboot the system if the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key
sequence is pressed.  
  
To configure the system to ignore the `Ctrl-Alt-Del` key sequence from
the Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of rebooting the system, add
or set `logout` to `string ''` in
`/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings`. For example:

``` 
[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
logout=''
```

Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
`/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock` to prevent user
modification. For example:

``` 
/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/logout
```

After the settings have been set, run `dconf update`.
