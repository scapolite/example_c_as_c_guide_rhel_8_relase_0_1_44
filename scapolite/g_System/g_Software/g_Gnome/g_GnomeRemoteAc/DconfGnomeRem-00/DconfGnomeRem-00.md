## /rule

Require Encryption for Remote Access in GNOME3

## /rationale

Open
X displays allow an attacker to capture keystrokes and to execute
commands remotely.

## /description

By
default, `GNOME` requires encryption when using `Vino` for remote
access. To prevent remote access encryption from being disabled, add or
set `require-encryption` to `true` in
`/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings`. For example:

``` 
[org/gnome/Vino]
require-encryption=true
```

Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
`/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock` to prevent user
modification. For example:

``` 
/org/gnome/Vino/require-encryption
```

After the settings have been set, run `dconf update`.
