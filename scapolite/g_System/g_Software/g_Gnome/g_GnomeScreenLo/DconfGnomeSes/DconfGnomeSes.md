## /rule

Ensure Users Cannot Change GNOME3 Session Idle Settings

## /rationale

A
session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work
and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the
absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their
operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, GNOME desktops
can be configured to identify when a user\'s session has idled and take
action to initiate the session lock. As such, users should not be
allowed to change session settings.

## /description

If
not already configured, ensure that users cannot change GNOME3 session
idle settings by adding `/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay` to
`/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock` to prevent user
modification. For example:

``` 
/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay
```

After the settings have been set, run `dconf update`.
