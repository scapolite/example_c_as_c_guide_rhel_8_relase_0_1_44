## /rule

Set GNOME3 Screensaver Inactivity Timeout

## /rationale

A
session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work
and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the
absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their
operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, GNOME3 can be
configured to identify when a user\'s session has idled and take action
to initiate a session lock.

## /description

The
idle time-out value for inactivity in the GNOME3 desktop is configured
via the `idle-delay` setting must be set under an appropriate
configuration file(s) in the `/etc/dconf/db/local.d` directory and
locked in `/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks` directory to prevent user
modification.  
  
For example, to configure the system for a 15 minute delay, add the
following to `/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings`:

``` 
[org/gnome/desktop/session]
idle-delay=uint32 900
```

Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
`/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock` to prevent user
modification. For example:

``` 
/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay
```

After the settings have been set, run `dconf update`.
