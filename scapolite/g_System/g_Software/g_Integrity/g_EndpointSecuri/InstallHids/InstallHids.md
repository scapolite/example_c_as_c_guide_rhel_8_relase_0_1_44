## /rule

Install Intrusion Detection Software

## /rationale

Host-based
intrusion detection tools provide a system-level defense when an
intruder gains access to a system or network.

## /description

The
base Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 platform already includes a
sophisticated auditing system that can detect intruder activity, as well
as SELinux, which provides host-based intrusion prevention capabilities
by confining privileged programs and user sessions which may become
compromised.
