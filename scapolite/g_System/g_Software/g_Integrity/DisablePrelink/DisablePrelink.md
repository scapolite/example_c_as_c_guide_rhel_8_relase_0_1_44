## /rule

Disable Prelinking

## /rationale

Because
the prelinking feature changes binaries, it can interfere with the
operation of certain software and/or modes such as AIDE, FIPS, etc.

## /description

The
prelinking feature changes binaries in an attempt to decrease their
startup time. In order to disable it, change or add the following line
inside the file `/etc/sysconfig/prelink`:

``` 
PRELINKING=no
```

Next, run the following command to return binaries to a normal,
non-prelinked state:

``` 
$ sudo /usr/sbin/prelink -ua
```
