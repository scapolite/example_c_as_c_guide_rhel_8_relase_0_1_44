## /rule

Verify and Correct Ownership with RPM

## /rationale

Ownership
of binaries and configuration files that is incorrect could allow an
unauthorized user to gain privileges that they should not have. The
ownership set by the vendor should be maintained. Any deviations from
this baseline should be investigated.

## /description

The
RPM package management system can check file ownership permissions of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security. After locating a file with incorrect permissions, which can be
found with

``` 
rpm -Va | awk '{ if (substr($0,6,1)=="U" || substr($0,7,1)=="G") print $NF }'
```

run the following command to determine which package owns it:

``` 
$ rpm -qf FILENAME
```

Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to the correct
values:

``` 
$ sudo rpm --setugids PACKAGENAME
```
