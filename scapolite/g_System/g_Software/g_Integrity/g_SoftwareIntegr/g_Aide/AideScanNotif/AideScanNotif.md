## /rule

Configure Notification of Post-AIDE Scan Details

## /rationale

Unauthorized
changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable
to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system.
Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side
effects, some of which may be relevant to security.  
  
Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help
avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the
security state of the operating system. The operating system\'s
Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer
(ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or
monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a
configuration item.

## /description

AIDE
should notify appropriate personnel of the details of a scan after the
scan has been run. If AIDE has already been configured for periodic
execution in `/etc/crontab`, append the following line to the existing
AIDE line:

``` 
 | /bin/mail -s "$(hostname) - AIDE Integrity Check" root@localhost
```

Otherwise, add the following line to `/etc/crontab`:

``` 
05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$(hostname) - AIDE Integrity Check" root@localhost
```

AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely
one example.
