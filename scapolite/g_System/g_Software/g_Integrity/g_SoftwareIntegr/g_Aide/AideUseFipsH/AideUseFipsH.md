## /rule

Configure AIDE to Use FIPS 140-2 for Validating Hashes

## /rationale

File
integrity tools use cryptographic hashes for verifying file contents and
directories have not been altered. These hashes must be FIPS 140-2
approved cryptographic hashes.

## /description

By
default, the `sha512` option is added to the `NORMAL` ruleset in AIDE.
If using a custom ruleset or the `sha512` option is missing, add
`sha512` to the appropriate ruleset. For example, add `sha512` to the
following line in `/etc/aide.conf`:

``` 
NORMAL = FIPSR+sha512
```

AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one
example that is already configured by default.
