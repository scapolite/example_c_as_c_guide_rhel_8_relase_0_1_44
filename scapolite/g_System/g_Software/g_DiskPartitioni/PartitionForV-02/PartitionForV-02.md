## /rule

Ensure /var/log/audit Located On Separate Partition

## /rationale

Placing
`/var/log/audit` in its own partition enables better separation between
audit files and other files, and helps ensure that auditing cannot be
halted due to the partition running out of space.

## /description

Audit
logs are stored in the `/var/log/audit` directory. Ensure that it has
its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it
later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to
store all audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.
