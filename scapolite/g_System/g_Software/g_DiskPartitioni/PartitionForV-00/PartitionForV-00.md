## /rule

Ensure /var Located On Separate Partition

## /rationale

Ensuring
that `/var` is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of more
restrictive mount options. This helps protect system services such as
daemons or other programs which use it. It is not uncommon for the
`/var` directory to contain world-writable directories installed by
other software packages.

## /description

The
`/var` directory is used by daemons and other system services to store
frequently-changing data. Ensure that `/var` has its own partition or
logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
