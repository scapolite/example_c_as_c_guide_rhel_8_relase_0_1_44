## /rule

Ensure /home Located On Separate Partition

## /rationale

Ensuring
that `/home` is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of more
restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that users cannot
trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.

## /description

If
user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate
partition for `/home` at installation time (or migrate it later using
LVM). If `/home` will be mounted from another system such as an NFS
server, then creating a separate partition is not necessary at
installation time, and the mountpoint can instead be configured later.
