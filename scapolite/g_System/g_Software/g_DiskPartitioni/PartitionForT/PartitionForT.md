## /rule

Ensure /tmp Located On Separate Partition

## /rationale

The
`/tmp` partition is used as temporary storage by many programs. Placing
`/tmp` in its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive
mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.

## /description

The
`/tmp` directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary file
storage. Ensure it has its own partition or logical volume at
installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
