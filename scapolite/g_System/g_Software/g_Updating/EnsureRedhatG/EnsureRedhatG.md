## /rule

Ensure Red Hat GPG Key Installed

## /rationale

Changes
to software components can have significant effects on the overall
security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software
has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted
vendor. The Red Hat GPG key is necessary to cryptographically verify
packages are from Red Hat.

## /description

To
ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages
come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive
them), the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed. To install the
Red Hat GPG key, run:

``` 
$ sudo subscription-manager register
```

If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite, then
install the Red Hat GPG key from trusted media such as the Red Hat
installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted in
`/media/cdrom`, use the following command as the root user to import it
into the keyring:

``` 
$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY
```
