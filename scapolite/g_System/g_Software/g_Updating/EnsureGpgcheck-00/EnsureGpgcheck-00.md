## /rule

Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for All yum Package Repositories

## /rationale

Verifying
the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the
integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures
the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by
a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this
requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an
approved Certificate Authority (CA).\"

## /description

To
ensure signature checking is not disabled for any repos, remove any
lines from files in `/etc/yum.repos.d` of the form:

``` 
gpgcheck=0
```
