## /rule

Configure SMTP Greeting Banner

## /rationale

The
default greeting banner discloses that the listening mail process is
Postfix. When remote mail senders connect to the MTA on port 25, they
are greeted by an initial banner as part of the SMTP dialogue. This
banner is necessary, but it frequently gives away too much information,
including the MTA software which is in use, and sometimes also its
version number. Remote mail senders do not need this information in
order to send mail, so the banner should be changed to reveal only the
hostname (which is already known and may be useful) and the word ESMTP,
to indicate that the modern SMTP protocol variant is supported.

## /description

Edit
`/etc/postfix/main.cf`, and add or correct the following line,
substituting some other wording for the banner information if you
prefer:

``` 
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP
```
