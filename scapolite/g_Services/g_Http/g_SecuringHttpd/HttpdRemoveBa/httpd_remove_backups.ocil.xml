          <question_text>Ensure that CGI backup scripts are not left on the production web server.
This check is limited to CGI/interactive content and not static HTML.

Search for backup copies of CGI scripts on the web server or ask the Web
Administrator if they keep backup copies of CGI scripts on the web server.

Common backup file extensions are: *.bak, *.old, *.temp, *.tmp, *.backup,
*.??0. This would also apply to .jsp files.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, run the following commands to find backup
scripts:
find / name "*.bak" -printfind / name "*.*" -printfind / name "*.old" -print
      Is it the case that If fileos with these extensions have no relationship with web activity,
such as backup batch file for operating system utility, and they are
not accessible by the web application, this is not a finding.

If files with these extensions are found in either the document
directory or the home directory of the web server, this is
a finding.

If files with these extensions are stored in a repository (not in the
document root) as backups for the web server?
