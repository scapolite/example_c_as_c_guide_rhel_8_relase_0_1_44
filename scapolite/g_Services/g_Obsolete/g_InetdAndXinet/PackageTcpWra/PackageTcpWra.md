## /rule

Install tcp\_wrappers Package

## /rationale

Access
control methods provide the ability to enhance system security posture
by restricting services and known good IP addresses and address ranges.
This prevents connections from unknown hosts and protocols.

## /description

When
network services are using the `xinetd` service, the `tcp_wrappers`
package should be installed. The `tcp_wrappers` package can be installed
with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo yum install tcp_wrappers
```
