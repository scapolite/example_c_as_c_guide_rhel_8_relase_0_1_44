To check that the telnet service is disabled in system boot configuration with xinetd, run the following command:
$ chkconfig telnet --list
Output should indicate the telnet service has either not been installed, or has been disabled, as shown in the example below:
$ chkconfig telnet --list

Note: This output shows SysV services only and does not include native
systemd services. SysV configuration data might be overridden by native
systemd configuration.

If you want to list systemd services use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
To see services enabled on particular target use
'systemctl list-dependencies [target]'.

telnet       off

To check that the telnet socket is disabled in system boot configuration with systemd, run the following command:
$ systemctl is-enabled telnet
Output should indicate the telnet socket has either not been installed,
or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:
$ systemctl is-enabled telnetdisabled

Run the following command to verify telnet is not active (i.e. not running) through current runtime configuration:
systemctl is-active telnet

If the socket is not running the command will return the following output:
inactive
      Is it the case that service and/or socket are running?
