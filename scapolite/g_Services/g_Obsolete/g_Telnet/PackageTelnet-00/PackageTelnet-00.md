## /rule

Remove telnet Clients

## /rationale

The
`telnet` protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted
transmission medium could allow an unauthorized user to steal
credentials. The `ssh` package provides an encrypted session and
stronger security and is included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

## /description

The
telnet client allows users to start connections to other systems via the
telnet protocol.
