## /rule

Uninstall talk-server Package

## /rationale

The
talk software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols
for communications. Removing the `talk-server` package decreases the
risk of the accidental (or intentional) activation of talk services.

## /description

The
`talk-server` package can be removed with the following command:

``` 
 $ sudo yum erase talk-server
```
