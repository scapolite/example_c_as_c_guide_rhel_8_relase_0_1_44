## /rule

Uninstall talk Package

## /rationale

The
talk software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols
for communications. Removing the `talk` package decreases the risk of
the accidental (or intentional) activation of talk client program.

## /description

The
`talk` package contains the client program for the Internet talk
protocol, which allows the user to chat with other users on different
systems. Talk is a communication program which copies lines from one
terminal to the terminal of another user. The `talk` package can be
removed with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo yum erase talk
```
