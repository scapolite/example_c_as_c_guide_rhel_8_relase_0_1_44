## /rule

Enable the NTP Daemon

## /rationale

Enabling
the `ntpd` service ensures that the `ntpd` service will be running and
that the system will synchronize its time to any servers specified. This
is important whether the system is configured to be a client (and
synchronize only its own clock) or it is also acting as an NTP server to
other systems. Synchronizing time is essential for authentication
services such as Kerberos, but it is also important for maintaining
accurate logs and auditing possible security breaches.  
  
The NTP daemon offers all of the functionality of `ntpdate`, which is
now deprecated. Additional information on this is available at
<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Dev/DeprecatingNtpdate>.

## /description

The `ntpd` service can be enabled with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo systemctl enable ntpd.service
```
