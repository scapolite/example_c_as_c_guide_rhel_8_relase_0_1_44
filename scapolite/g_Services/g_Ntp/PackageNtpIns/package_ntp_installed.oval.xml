  <!--ATTENTION: some OVAL entities defined below ALSO OCCUR in OVAL definitions
for other rules - a mechanism generating SCAP from these sources must ensure that
multiple definitions of the same entity are exactly the same.
When using 'localized' per-rule OVAL, as encouraged by the Scapolite format
it is probaly preferable to structure OVAL differently and work with shared OVAL files.
The OVAL presented here has been exported automatically but no such optimization
using shared OVAL files has been carried out.
Here is the list of identifies for OVAL entities that also occur in other rules:
 - 'oval:ssg-obj_package_ntp_installed:obj:1'
- 'oval:ssg-test_package_ntp_installed:tst:1'  -->
