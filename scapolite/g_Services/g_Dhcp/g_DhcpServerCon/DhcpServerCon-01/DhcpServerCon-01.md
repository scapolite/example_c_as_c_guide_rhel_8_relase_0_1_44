## /rule

Configure Logging

## /rationale

By
default, dhcpd logs notices to the daemon facility. Sending all daemon
messages to a dedicated log file is part of the syslog configuration
outlined in the Logging and Auditing section

## /description

Ensure
that the following line exists in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:

``` 
daemon.*           /var/log/daemon.log
```

Configure logwatch or other log monitoring tools to summarize error
conditions reported by the dhcpd process.
