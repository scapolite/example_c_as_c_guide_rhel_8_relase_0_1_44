## /rule

Uninstall quagga Package

## /rationale

Routing
software is typically used on routers to exchange network topology
information with other routers. If routing software is used when not
required, system network information may be unnecessarily transmitted
across the network.  
If there is no need to make the router software available, removing it
provides a safeguard against its activation.

## /description

The
`quagga` package can be removed with the following command:

``` 
 $ sudo yum erase quagga
```
