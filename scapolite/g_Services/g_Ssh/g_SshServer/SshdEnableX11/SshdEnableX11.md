## /rule

Enable Encrypted X11 Forwarding

## /rationale

Open
X displays allow an attacker to capture keystrokes and to execute
commands remotely.

## /description

By
default, remote X11 connections are not encrypted when initiated by
users. SSH has the capability to encrypt remote X11 connections when
SSH\'s `X11Forwarding` option is enabled.  
  
To enable X11 Forwarding, add or correct the following line in
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

``` 
X11Forwarding yes
```
