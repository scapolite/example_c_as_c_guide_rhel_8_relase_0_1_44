## /rule

Disable SSH Support for User Known Hosts

## /rationale

Configuring
this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that
remove login via SSH will require a password, even in the event of
misconfiguration elsewhere.

## /description

SSH
can allow system users user host-based authentication to connect to
systems if a cache of the remote systems public keys are available. This
should be disabled.  
  
To ensure this behavior is disabled, add or correct the following line
in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

``` 
IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
```
