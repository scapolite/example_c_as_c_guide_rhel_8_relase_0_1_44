## /rule

Disable Compression Or Set Compression to delayed

## /rationale

If
compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication,
vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise
of the system from an unauthenticated connection, potentially wih root
privileges.

## /description

Compression
is useful for slow network connections over long distances but can cause
performance issues on local LANs. If use of compression is required, it
should be enabled only after a user has authenticated; otherwise , it
should be disabled. To disable compression or delay compression until
after a user has successfully authenticated, add or correct the
following line in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

``` 
Compression no
```

or

``` 
Compression delayed
```
