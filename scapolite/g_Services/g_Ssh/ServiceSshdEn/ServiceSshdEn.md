## /rule

Enable the OpenSSH Service

## /rationale

Without
protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality, and
integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be
intercepted and either read or altered.  
  
This checklist item applies to both internal and external networks and
all types of information system components from which information can be
transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers,
printers, copiers, scanners, etc). Communication paths outside the
physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the
possibility of interception and modification.

## /description

The
SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed. The `sshd` service can be
enabled with the following command:

``` 
$ sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
```
