title: Configure Security Tools to Improve System Robustness
description: <see below>

## /description

Several
tools exist which can be effectively used to improve a system\'s
resistance to and detection of unknown attacks. These tools can improve
robustness against attack at the cost of relatively little configuration
effort. In particular, this guide recommends and discusses the use of
host-based firewalling, SELinux for protection against vulnerable
services, and a logging and auditing infrastructure for detection of
problems.
